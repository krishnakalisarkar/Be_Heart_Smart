* Heart disease is one of the most common causes of death in the world. This is true for the United States as well. 
* According to CDC heart disease is the leading cause of death in the US 
* In 2019 over 659 thousand people died of heart disease.
* Early and accurate prediction of heart disease is crucial to prevent further damage to patient's health and death.
* Machine learning algorithms can be helpful in diagnosing people at risk of heart disease and assist in making more informed decisions.

## Questions expected to be answered with our Machine Learning model

* Is a person at risk of heart disease?
* What are the potential risk factors for heart disease--smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, etc?
* Which factors are the best predictors of heart disease?


## Machine learning models that will used in our analyses

* Our dataset is large with over 60 thousand observations and 11 features. 
* Our aim is to predict presence of heart disease. Hence accuracy is an important determinat in selecting our model.
* We try different machine learning algorithms to compare and determine the model that will predict presence of heart disease timely and accurately.
* Our machine learning model will be a classification model since we have a target variable and which is if the person has a heart disease or not. Hence, the two possible outcomes are: "Yes" or "No".
* We will be employing supervised machine learning and artificial neural network algorithms for our analysis.
* The supervised machine learning algorithms we will be using are : 1) Logistic regression, 2) Support vector machine, 3) Random Forests, 4) Gradient Boosting.
*  We will also be usuing basic neural networks and deep neural network models. These are suitable for interpreting large, complex data and non-linear relationships. They also allows optimizing the model and produce high accuracy results.
